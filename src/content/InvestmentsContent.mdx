# Investments
In 2023, the SBI invested over three billion dollars in entities that are either complicit in, or benefit from, the Israeli occupation. These investments include weapons manufacturing companies, pharmaceutical companies, the tourism industry, heavy machinery, and all the way down to investments into the state of Israel directly.

## Weapons
The SBI is an enabler of the carpet bombing, invasion, occupation, and ongoing genocide in Palestine. It invests in companies like Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and Israel’s own Elbit Systems -- who boast that their products are tested on Palestinians. A news report from ‘Who Profits’ states that, “As in previous military onslaughts on Gaza, the Israeli military is currently testing new weapons and technologies through their inaugural operational deployment.”
In total, the SBI invested $413 million into the war industry. Every dollar invested acts as a potential life lost.

## Industries of Apartheid
The Israeli apartheid state is made possible through an unambiguous system of support from multinational corporations. Notable examples include AirBnB allowing settlers to have ‘getaways’ on stolen land, and massive tech companies like Microsoft making the active surveillance of Palestinians possible. In particular, Caterpillar's armored bulldozers are used to collapse the homes of Palestinians (often with people still inside). These machines were used as crowd control and to attack Palestinian protesters during the Great March of Return.
The SBI provides financial support to these corporations that make up the resources and tools of the of apartheid state of Israel.

## Investing in Israel
The SBI supports the apartheid state of Israel by investing $25 million in bonds directly into the state, and another $10 million into Israeli Banks. The SBI further invests in Israeli businesses that profit not only off of stolen land, but also Palestinian labor as they act as both landlord and boss. Investing in both the state of Israel and the corporations further exacerbates the system of apartheid, and sustains the alliance between the US and Israel as imperial forces.
