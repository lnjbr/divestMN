[The State Board of Investment (SBI)](https://msbi.us/) is a government body that invests state pensions and retirement funds. These investments include publicly traded stocks, securities, and private equity firms. The market value of their managed assets currently totals 138 billion dollars but, for the purposes of this website, we will focus on the 3.25 billion dollars that go directly into supporting the settler state of Israel.
