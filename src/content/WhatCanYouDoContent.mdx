# What can you do?

Change requires collective action. Your voice, your opinion, and your direct action matters.
You can take action today by calling the members of the SBI and making clear to them that it is unacceptable for our state tax dollars to go to apartheid Israel. Please use the infographic below for both the numbers and a call-in script.
You can take action by signing our [divestment petition](https://form.jotform.com/antiwarmn/AWCSBIpetition) so that we can provide the SBI a quantifiable number of Minnesota residents at each meeting, letting them know that we are not comfortable funding the genocide of the Palestinian people.
You can take action by following the Free Palestine Coalition organizations on social media platforms to stay in touch for the next action.
