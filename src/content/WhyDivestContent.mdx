# Why divest

Divestment is a political act. It demands that we break the ties between the US and Israel. It demands that those who profit, prop up, sustain, and help create the apartheid state of Israel feel the consequences of their actions. It demands that Israel, above all else, understands that these actions of terror, settlement, colonization, occupation and genocide will not go unseen and they will be held accountable.
We must do all we can to isolate the state of Israel. The SBI previously divested from the apartheid in South Africa in the 1980s and we can stand by that precedent and do it again.
